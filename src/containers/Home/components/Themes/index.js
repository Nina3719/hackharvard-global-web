            HackHarvard is uniquely situated because of our experienced
            hackathon organizing team, immense international demand for our
            event, and universityâ€™s recognition in countries around the world.
            This positioning necessitates our expansion beyond just our
            in-person 36-hour hackathon event:

            away to attend HackHarvard in person. The event will address global
            problems, emphasizing three themes:
