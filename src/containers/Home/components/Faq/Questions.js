  "Will transportation be provided for the final ceremony?":
    "If you are selected as a finalist for HackHarvard Global in one of three tracks, you may have a chance to be flown out with your team to present to top companies. Keep an eye out for an email after the semi-final round regarding this!",
  "What happens if I use a hard to obtain data set?":
    "The datasets you use must be accessible to anyone. In your submission, you must submit the website from which you obtained the data and/or the contact who gave you access to the data.",
  "Does my project have to fit in one of the three tracks?":
    "Yes, your project must be under one of three tasks. However, you have a lot of freedom within each track-- the questions and scenarios we wrote about are just the starting point!",
  "Do I have to use all the space provided (ex. 2 pages for open round, 10 pages for semifinals round)":
    "No. More pages do not mean a better score. We will assess your submission on quality of work rather than pages filled up!",
  "Will late submissions be accepted?":
    "Late submissions will not be accepted under any circumstances to allow for an equitable competition. The HackHarvardGlobal round deadlines are fixed.",
  "Will this affect/benefit admittance into harvard":
    "HackHarvardGlobal is organized by HackHarvard, hosted in partnership with Alibaba and Zhejiang Labs. We are in no way affiliated with the Harvard Admissions Office. That said, it never hurts to have placement in a Harvard global competition on your resume.",
  "What is your policy on submitting past work?":
    "Generally, all substantial work should be completed during the competition timeline. Boilerplate code is acceptable, but more specific work, such as work completed for a thesis, is not acceptable.",
  "What will Tianchi/Alibaba do with the information I submit":
    "The information that you submit will be used for evaluating your work that you submit for the competition. However, should you advance to further rounds, Tianchi/Alibaba may contact you for career opportunities and use your information to influence policy decisions.",
  "Who is organizing this competition?":
    "HackHarvardGlobal is organized by HackHarvard, hosted in partnership with Alibaba and Zhejiang Labs. HackHarvardGlobal aims to provide access to those who are too far away to attend HackHarvard in person, with the goal of encouraging technological innovation to promote the common good and develop citizens of the world.",
  "Do I need to be an expert to participate? What level of competition should I expect? Do I need past experience?":
    "HackHarvardGlobal is open to participants of all levels, whether this is your first hackathon or your hundredth hackathon. We assume no prior experience with hackathons. All we require is that participants have a strong passion for problem solving and a desire to help communities by solving local problems through innovative solutions. Although we aim to attract participants of all skill levels, we will be evaluating submissions not just on the level of technical complexity demonstrated, but also on the clarity, creativity, and presentation of the submissions."
